## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![alt text](images/1.png)
vehicle_length and ground_clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.

The slope of the other three variables: vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and AWD are considered to be zero.

This linear model predict mpg of MechaCar effectively, because the p-value of the F-statistic is very small 5.35e-11.
